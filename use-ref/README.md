make botton and use the event for that with useState handle it.
    .handleClick event should be number + one and use the update functoin .

1. use useEffect and get console log that get the meaing of useRf.

2. set useRf to constans name "ref"
    .change handleClick to ref.current++.
    .get log inside useEffect (ref.currrent)

3. add input after button elements.
    .set ref attribute (inputRef).
    .change the inside handleEvent like you want (be curious please.)
